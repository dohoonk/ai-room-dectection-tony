# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Core Algorithm: Convert Polygon to Bounding Box
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Convert detected polygons into axis-aligned bounding boxes.
# Details:
Use shapely to convert polygon cycles into bounding boxes, ensuring they are axis-aligned for simplicity. Implement pytest unit tests to cover bounding box calculation accuracy, axis-aligned conversion, and edge cases such as degenerate polygons and single points.

# Test Strategy:
Create pytest unit tests to verify bounding boxes accurately encompass the detected polygons. Include at least 5-7 test cases to ensure good coverage, focusing on accuracy, axis alignment, and handling of edge cases.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Unit Tests for Bounding Box Calculation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create pytest unit tests to verify the accuracy of bounding box calculations.
### Details:
Ensure tests cover various polygon shapes and sizes.

## 2. Test Axis-Aligned Conversion [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure bounding boxes are axis-aligned.
### Details:
Test with polygons that have non-axis-aligned edges to confirm conversion.

## 3. Handle Edge Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test edge cases such as degenerate polygons and single points.
### Details:
Include tests for polygons that collapse into lines or points.

## 4. Verify Encompassment of Polygons [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure bounding boxes correctly encompass the original polygons.
### Details:
Test with complex polygons to ensure full coverage.

## 5. Implement Polygon to Bounding Box Conversion [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use shapely to convert cycles to bounding boxes
### Details:
Implement a function that takes a cycle (list of nodes) and uses shapely to create a polygon, then extract its axis-aligned bounding box.

## 6. Ensure Axis-Alignment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify bounding boxes are axis-aligned
### Details:
Ensure all bounding boxes are axis-aligned (aligned with x and y axes) as required by the MVP specification.

## 7. Calculate Bounding Box Coordinates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Extract min/max coordinates for each bounding box
### Details:
Calculate and return the bounding box coordinates in the format [min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y] for each detected room.
