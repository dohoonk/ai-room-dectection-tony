# Task ID: 10
# Title: Build React Frontend with Material UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up the React project with Material UI and create a basic UI component to visualize wall line segments from JSON.
# Details:
Initialize a React project and integrate Material UI. Implement a basic file upload feature for JSON files and create a canvas or SVG component to draw wall line segments based on the JSON data. Include component tests using Jest and React Testing Library for each part.

# Test Strategy:
Perform manual testing to ensure the React project initializes correctly, Material UI components are styled properly, and the canvas/SVG component accurately visualizes wall line segments from uploaded JSON files. Additionally, implement Jest and React Testing Library tests for each component to ensure functionality and integration.
