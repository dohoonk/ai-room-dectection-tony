# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Local Backend API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a REST API endpoint for room detection using Express.js or FastAPI. This API will work in conjunction with the UI component in task 11 to display detected room bounding boxes.
# Details:
Set up a local server with an endpoint that accepts wall-line JSON and returns detected room bounding boxes. This API will enable manual testing through the React UI developed in task 11. Implement integration tests to ensure the API handles various scenarios effectively.

# Test Strategy:
Use Postman to test API endpoint, ensuring correct input/output handling. Additionally, verify integration with the React UI in task 11 for manual testing. Create integration tests using pytest (for FastAPI) or Jest/Supertest (for Express) to cover: valid JSON acceptance, correct room detection results, invalid input handling, error handling, and response format validation. Include 5-7 integration test cases for comprehensive coverage.
