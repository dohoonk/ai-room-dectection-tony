# Task ID: 19
# Title: Create React UI Component for Wall Adjacency Graph Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a React component using Material UI to visualize the wall adjacency graph and highlight detected cycles.
# Details:
Set up a new React component within the existing project structure. Use Material UI for styling and layout. Implement a canvas or SVG element to render the graph nodes and edges. Integrate with the backend to fetch graph data, including nodes, edges, and detected cycles. Highlight cycles using distinct colors or styles for easy identification. Ensure the component is responsive and can handle dynamic data updates. Provide controls for zooming and panning to navigate large graphs.

# Test Strategy:
Test the component by integrating it with the backend endpoints from tasks 4 and 5. Use sample data to verify that the graph is rendered correctly and cycles are highlighted. Perform manual testing to ensure the UI is responsive and interactive. Validate that the component updates correctly when new data is received. Additionally, implement automated tests using Jest and React Testing Library to cover graph visualization rendering, cycle highlighting, node and edge display, zoom/pan controls, data updates, and Material UI integration. Include at least 5-7 component test cases with good coverage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up React Component Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the initial structure for the React component using Material UI.
### Details:
Initialize a new React component file within the existing project. Use Material UI components for basic layout.

## 2. Implement Node and Edge Rendering [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Render graph nodes and edges using canvas or SVG.
### Details:
Use a canvas or SVG element to draw nodes and edges. Ensure nodes are positioned correctly and edges connect nodes.

## 3. Highlight Detected Cycles [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Implement cycle highlighting using distinct colors or styles.
### Details:
Identify cycles in the graph data and apply distinct colors or styles to highlight them.

## 4. Add Zoom and Pan Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Implement controls for zooming and panning the graph.
### Details:
Add interactive controls to allow users to zoom in/out and pan across the graph visualization.

## 5. Integrate with Backend API [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Fetch graph data from the backend and update the component.
### Details:
Connect to the backend API to retrieve nodes, edges, and cycle data. Update the component to reflect dynamic data changes.
