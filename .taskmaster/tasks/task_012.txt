# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Observability Features
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add UI elements to display processing metrics such as detection time and confidence score.
# Details:
Enhance the UI to show metrics like rooms detected, processing time, and confidence score using Material UI components. Ensure integration with React components for real-time updates.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that metrics are accurately displayed and updated in real-time during processing. Implement component tests using Jest and React Testing Library to cover metrics display rendering, real-time updates, Material UI component integration, and accurate calculation and display of metrics.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Jest and React Testing Library tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop component tests for metrics display rendering, real-time updates, and Material UI integration.
### Details:
Include at least 3-5 test cases to ensure good coverage of the observability features.

## 2. Create Metrics Display Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build Material UI component to display metrics
### Details:
Create a React component using Material UI (e.g., Card, Typography) to display metrics like rooms detected count, processing time, and confidence score.

## 3. Implement Processing Time Calculation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Calculate and display processing time
### Details:
Track the time from when room detection starts until results are received, and display it in a user-friendly format (e.g., "2.34 seconds").

## 4. Implement Confidence Score Calculation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Calculate confidence score for detections
### Details:
Implement logic to calculate a confidence score (0.00-1.00) based on factors like cycle size, shape regularity, and detection quality.

## 5. Add Real-Time Updates [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update metrics in real-time during processing
### Details:
Implement real-time updates to the metrics display as processing progresses, using React state management and potentially WebSocket or polling.
