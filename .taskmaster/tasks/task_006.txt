# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Core Algorithm: Filter Cycles
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Filter detected cycles by size and shape to ignore invalid polygons.
# Details:
Apply filtering criteria to remove small or irregular cycles that do not represent valid rooms. Implement pytest unit tests to ensure the filtering criteria are correctly applied.

# Test Strategy:
Create pytest unit tests covering: filtering small cycles, filtering irregular shapes, keeping valid room-sized cycles, and edge cases (boundary conditions). Include at least 5-7 test cases for comprehensive coverage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create pytest unit tests for filtering small cycles [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop unit tests to ensure small cycles are filtered out correctly.
### Details:
Write tests that check if cycles below a certain size threshold are removed.

## 2. Create pytest unit tests for filtering irregular shapes [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop unit tests to ensure irregular shapes are filtered out correctly.
### Details:
Write tests that check if cycles with irregular shapes are removed.

## 3. Create pytest unit tests for keeping valid room-sized cycles [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop unit tests to ensure valid room-sized cycles are retained.
### Details:
Write tests that check if cycles representing valid rooms are kept.

## 4. Create pytest unit tests for edge cases [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop unit tests to cover edge cases in filtering criteria.
### Details:
Write tests for boundary conditions and unusual scenarios.

## 5. Verify filtering criteria with comprehensive test coverage [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure the filtering criteria work correctly with a variety of test cases.
### Details:
Review and refine test cases to ensure all aspects of filtering are covered.

## 6. Implement Size-Based Filtering [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Filter cycles based on size thresholds
### Details:
Implement logic to calculate cycle area/perimeter and filter out cycles that are too small to represent valid rooms (e.g., closets, hall fragments).

## 7. Implement Shape-Based Filtering [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Filter cycles based on shape characteristics
### Details:
Implement logic to identify and filter out irregular shapes (e.g., extremely elongated, non-convex) that don't represent typical rooms.

## 8. Define Filtering Criteria and Thresholds [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the filtering parameters
### Details:
Define minimum size thresholds, aspect ratio limits, and other criteria for determining valid room cycles. Make these configurable.

## 9. Apply Filters to Detected Cycles [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply all filtering criteria to the cycle list
### Details:
Create a function that applies size and shape filters to the list of detected cycles, returning only valid room candidates.
