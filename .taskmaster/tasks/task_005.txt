# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Core Algorithm: Detect Closed Loops
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Detect closed loops (cycles) in the wall adjacency graph.
# Details:
Use networkx to identify cycles in the graph, representing potential room boundaries. Implement pytest unit tests to ensure comprehensive coverage of cycle detection.

# Test Strategy:
Create pytest unit tests covering: cycle detection in simple and complex graphs, handling of graphs with no cycles, multiple cycles, nested cycles, and verify all closed loops are identified. Include at least 5-7 test cases with good coverage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Unit Tests for Cycle Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create pytest unit tests for cycle detection in various graph scenarios.
### Details:
Develop tests for simple graphs, complex graphs, graphs with no cycles, multiple cycles, and nested cycles.

## 2. Implement Cycle Detection Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use networkx to detect cycles in the graph
### Details:
Implement a function that uses networkx cycle detection algorithms to find all closed loops in the wall adjacency graph.

## 3. Filter Duplicate Cycles [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove duplicate and redundant cycles
### Details:
Implement logic to filter out duplicate cycles (same nodes in different order) and ensure each unique cycle is only returned once.

## 4. Structure Cycle Data for Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Format detected cycles for further processing
### Details:
Convert networkx cycle data into a structured format (list of node sequences) that can be used by subsequent algorithm steps.
