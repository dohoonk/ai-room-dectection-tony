# Task ID: 8
# Title: Normalize Bounding Box Coordinates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Normalize bounding box coordinates to a 0–1000 scale.
# Details:
Scale bounding box coordinates to fit within a 0–1000 coordinate system, maintaining aspect ratio. Implement pytest unit tests to ensure correctness.

# Test Strategy:
Create pytest unit tests to cover normalization to 0-1000 range, aspect ratio preservation, edge cases (already normalized, extreme coordinates), and verify all coordinates are within bounds. Include at least 5-7 test cases with good coverage.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Unit Tests for Normalization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create pytest unit tests for bounding box normalization.
### Details:
Develop tests to ensure bounding boxes are normalized to a 0-1000 range, maintaining aspect ratio.

## 2. Test Aspect Ratio Preservation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Ensure aspect ratio is preserved during normalization.
### Details:
Write tests to confirm aspect ratio is maintained after normalization.

## 3. Handle Edge Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Test edge cases for bounding box normalization.
### Details:
Include tests for already normalized boxes and extreme coordinates.

## 4. Implement Normalization Algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the normalization function to scale coordinates
### Details:
Implement a function that scales bounding box coordinates to fit within the 0-1000 coordinate system while maintaining the original aspect ratio.

## 5. Preserve Aspect Ratio During Scaling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure aspect ratio is maintained during normalization
### Details:
Calculate the scaling factor that maintains the original aspect ratio while fitting coordinates within the 0-1000 range.

## 6. Ensure Coordinates Within 0-1000 Range [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Validate all coordinates are within bounds
### Details:
Add validation to ensure all normalized coordinates fall within the 0-1000 range, handling edge cases like already-normalized or extreme coordinates.
